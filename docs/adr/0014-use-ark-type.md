# 14. Use ArkType

Date: 2025-04-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need runtime type validation library for import data.

## Decision

We use [ArkType](https://arktype.io/).

Compared to [Zod](https://zod.dev/), we decided that the following would be suitable for swiki:

- Compact size
- More human readable rule description
