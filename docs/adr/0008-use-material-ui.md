# 8. Use Material-UI

Date: 2024-10-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need UI Component library.

## Decision

We use [Material-UI](https://mui.com/).

- The UI of this app is based on [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) that is Android's standard
- [Material Design 3 Web](https://m3.material.io/develop/web) is still in development and is missing some components that this app requires.

## Consequences

We can use various components provided by Material-UI.
