# 12. Use react-i18next

Date: 2024-10-31

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a library for internationalization.

Internationalization is not a high priority, but early adoption will help spread out the costs involved.

## Decision

We use [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/).

## Consequences

It is necessary to be aware of translation when writing text(no translations available for the time being).
