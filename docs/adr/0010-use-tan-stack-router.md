# 10. Use TanStack Router

Date: 2024-10-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need routing library.

## Decision

We use [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/).

The most popular client-side routing library for React is [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/). However, React Router is too powerful and has features that this app does not need. TanStack Router is simpler than React Router and provides a better developer experience.

## Consequences

We will reconsider this if we decide to integrate with the backend.
