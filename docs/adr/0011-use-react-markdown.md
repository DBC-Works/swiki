# 11. Use react-markdown

Date: 2024-10-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a library to convert markdown to HTML.

## Decision

We use [react-markdown](https://remarkjs.github.io/react-markdown/).

react-markdown is based on [remark](https://remark.js.org/), so we can use various plugins for remark.

## Consequences

This is our first time using react-markdown. If we encounter any issues that we cannot solve, we will consider using another library.
